1. How would you describe the concept of "state"?
state is hooks used to change the value and save within the componets
Ans: A way for React to remember saved values from within a component.
This is similar to declaring variables from within a component,
with a few added bonuses (which we'll get to later)


2. When would you want to use props instead of state?
Ans: when we don't want to edit data passed as parameter in function
Ans: Anytime you want to pass data into a component so that
component can determine what will get displayed on the
screen.
3. When would you want to use state instead of props?
Ans: when we want change some varibale within the componets
Ans:Anytime you want a component to maintain some values from
within the component. (And "remember" those values even
when React re-renders the component).

4. What does "immutable" mean? Are props immutable? Is state immutable?
Ans: immutable: not changebal, props are immutable
